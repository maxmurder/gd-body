# gd-body

Procedural physical material bodyplan and biological system implementation in gdscript.

An attempt at a easily customizable "Dwarf Fortress" like physical damage system in godot.

gd-body.gd acts as a data container to store information about the generated body using the configuration nodes with a gd-limb.gd script attached in its decendant tree. The resulting data containers can be then used to track and implement any number or type of system/part relationships.
